# Document Manager Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the recent changes made to implement manual chunk creation and deletion functionality in the document manager system. These changes allow administrators to manually add new chunks to existing documents and delete individual chunks or entire documents.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Knowledge Base Service (`knowledge_base_service.py`)
Added new functions for manual chunk management:

#### Create Manual Chunk
```python
def create_manual_document_chunk(
    qdrant_client: QdrantClient,
    embedding_model: Embeddings,
    chunk_create_schema: kb_schemas.DocumentChunkCreateManual,
    admin_username: Optional[str] = None,
) -> kb_schemas.DocumentChunkDetail
```
- Creates a new chunk with provided text content and source file
- Automatically assigns the next available chunk index
- Generates embeddings for the new content
- Stores metadata including creation timestamp and text snippet

#### Delete Chunk
```python
def delete_document_chunk(
    qdrant_client: QdrantClient,
    point_id: str,
    admin_username: Optional[str] = None,
) -> bool
```
- Deletes a specific chunk by its point ID
- Returns success/failure status

#### Delete Document
```python
def delete_document_chunks_by_source_file(
    qdrant_client: QdrantClient,
    source_file: str,
    admin_username: Optional[str] = None,
) -> dict
```
- Deletes all chunks associated with a source file
- Returns operation status and message

### 2. API Endpoints (`admin_kb.py`)
Added new endpoints for chunk management:

#### Create Chunk Endpoint
```python
@router.post("/chunks/manual")
```
- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/admin/knowledge-base/chunks/manual`
- Creates a new chunk manually
- Requires text content and source file
- Returns the created chunk details

#### Delete Chunk Endpoint
```python
@router.delete("/chunks/{point_id}")
```
- Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/admin/knowledge-base/chunks/{point_id}`
- Deletes a specific chunk
- Returns success/failure status

#### Delete Document Endpoint
```python
@router.delete("/chunks/by-file/{source_file_name}")
```
- Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/admin/knowledge-base/chunks/by-file/{source_file_name}`
- Deletes all chunks for a specific document
- Returns operation status

## Frontend Changes (Streamlit)

### Document Manager UI (`document_manager.py`)
Added new UI elements and functionality:

#### Add New Chunk
- "Add New Chunk" button appears when a document is selected
- Opens a form with:
  - Text area for chunk content
  - Save and Cancel buttons
- Validates input before submission
- Shows success/error messages

#### Delete Functionality
1. Document Deletion:
   - "Delete Document" button at the top
   - Two-step confirmation process:
     1. Initial warning
     2. Yes/No confirmation buttons
   - Success/error feedback

2. Chunk Deletion:
   - "Delete Chunk" button for each chunk
   - Two-step confirmation process
   - Success/error feedback

#### State Management
Added session state variables:
- `pending_deletion`: Tracks document deletion confirmation
- `pending_chunk_deletion`: Tracks chunk deletion confirmation
- `show_add_chunk`: Controls new chunk form visibility

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Chunk
1. Select a document from the dropdown
2. Click "Add New Chunk"
3. Enter the chunk content
4. Click "Save Chunk"
5. The new chunk appears in the list with the next available index

### Deleting a Chunk
1. Expand the chunk you want to delete
2. Click "Delete Chunk"
3. Confirm deletion in the confirmation dialog
4. The chunk is removed from the list

### Deleting a Document
1. Select the document to delete
2. Click "Delete Document"
3. Confirm deletion in the confirmation dialog
4. All chunks for that document are removed

## Error Handling
- Input validation for empty chunk content
- Server connection error handling
- API error message display
- Proper error logging on the backend

## Security
- All operations require admin authentication
- Token validation for all API calls
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements to consider:
1. Batch chunk creation
2. Chunk reordering functionality
3. Chunk merging/splitting
4. Undo/redo functionality
5. Chunk version history
